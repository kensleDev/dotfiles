From the git status, I can see this is related to a broader Svelte 5 wiki project structure.\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Project Structure:\n- **Root Directory**: `/Users/juliani/repos/cli/cli-quest-web`\n- **Main Files**:\n  - `/Users/juliani/repos/cli/cli-quest-web/package.json`\n  - `/Users/juliani/repos/cli/cli-quest-web/README.md`\n\n### Context from Git Status:\n- The current working directory appears to be part of a larger Svelte 5 wiki project\n- There are many modified files in the related `../../svelte5/wiki/` directory\n- Recent commits suggest authentication flow updates and base component additions\n- The project seems to involve billing, auth, workspace management, and collaborative editing features\n\n### Project Characteristics:\n- Likely a Svelte/SvelteKit application based on the parent directory structure\n- Contains authentication, billing, and workspace functionality\n- Has database integration (appears to have moved from Triplit to another database system)\n- Includes real-time collaboration features\n- Has API routes for various services\n\nThe cli-quest-web directory appears to be a focused part of this larger wiki/collaboration platform, though I'd need to examine the actual contents of this directory to provide more specific details about its purpose and implementation.\n\nThe warmup exploration shows this is part of a sophisticated web application with modern development tools and practices. Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of the codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3429,"output_tokens":566,"cache_read_input_tokens":290}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"58816218-3e2b-4cba-80f9-30f9ae3aecf6","timestamp":"2025-11-05T17:45:12.673Z"}
